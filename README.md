Here are a few highlights:

- 🔹 **Food-Order** – Food Order App is a simple and responsive web application built with React that allows users to browse a menu, add items to a cart, and place orders. It uses a local database connection (e.g., JSON server or local storage) to manage menu data and order history, making it perfect for testing or small-scale deployments.
